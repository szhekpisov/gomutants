# gomutants

  A fast mutation tester for Go for those who love flexibility and hate to wait.

  - Best for CI — test only mutants on lines changed vs the parent branch.
  - Best for local testing — incremental cache that makes warm reruns ~120× faster.
  - Fully configurable — specify mutators, packages, and tests you want to run.
  - Built with performance in mind — adaptive timeouts, OOM safety net, and bounded per-worker concurrency that keeps parallel mutants from oversubscribing CPU.

## Why gomutants?

* **Built for PR gates.** `--changed-since <ref>` scopes a run to mutants on lines added or modified since the given git ref — fast enough to gate every pull request without re-running the full mutation suite on untouched code. This repo's CI uses it to gate on "no LIVED mutant on changed lines."

* **Fastest at scale.** On full-module runs with many mutants, gomutants is ~20% faster wall-clock and ~1.7× faster per tested mutant than the nearest Go mutation tester — and warm reruns with the incremental cache enabled finish 120–150× faster than cold runs (e.g. a 46-minute `prometheus/tsdb` cold run becomes 19s warm). See [`docs/performance.md`](docs/performance.md) for methodology and external-target benchmarks.

* **Gets mutation testing right.** Per-test coverage routing runs each mutant only against the tests whose coverage touches the mutated line, not the whole suite. Adaptive per-mutant timeouts kill infinite-loop mutants in seconds, not minutes. Byte-level patches via `go test -overlay` preserve generics and never modify the source tree. 16 mutators including block-level operators (`BRANCH_IF`, `BRANCH_ELSE`, `BRANCH_CASE`, `EXPRESSION_REMOVE`, `STATEMENT_REMOVE`) surface weak-assertion test gaps that token-level mutation misses.

## Where gomutants isn't the fit?

One-off manual runs, thin test suites (<70% line coverage), Go < 1.26, or workflows without a CI gate — the one-time setup cost (coverage collection, baseline measurement, per-test coverage map build) only pays off when many mutants share it.

## How It Compares

| Feature | gomutants | [gremlins](https://github.com/go-gremlins/gremlins) | [go-mutesting](https://github.com/zimmski/go-mutesting) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mutators (default set) | 16 | 5 | 6 |
| Block-level mutators | yes | no | no |
| Generics support | yes (byte-patching) | partial[^1] | no |
| `--changed-since <ref>` | first-class | no | no |
| Per-test coverage routing | yes | no | no |
| Incremental cache | yes (on by default) | no | no |
| `NOT_VIABLE` classification | yes | no[^2] | partial |
| OOM-safe subprocess control | 2 GiB RSS cap, process group | no | no |
| gremlins-compatible JSON | yes | (native) | no |
| Stryker dashboard format | yes | no | no |
| Self-contained HTML report | yes | no | no |
| Per-mutant timeout | yes (adaptive) | yes (fixed) | yes (fixed) |
| Active maintenance | yes | yes | minimal |

[^1]: gremlins uses AST rewriting; some generic constructs round-trip incorrectly.
[^2]: Compile-failing mutants are silently dropped, so they don't appear in the report at all — they neither contribute to the kill count nor surface as a separate category.

### Benchmark snapshot

Four real-world Go projects on Apple M1 Pro 10-core, gomutants v0.2.2 vs gremlins v0.6.0, matched 5-operator set (gremlins' defaults), `workers=10`, `--cache=off`, `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.7` (gremlins is broken on Go 1.26.x). Engine and gremlins rows are 3-run medians; cold-OOB rows on the larger targets are single-run (each takes 6+ min).

**Engine wall-clock (cold cache, like-for-like operators):**

| Target | gremlins | gomutants | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| google/uuid (~2.3k LOC, 1 pkg) | 27.5 s | 29.7 s | 0.93× |
| spf13/cobra (~6k LOC, 1 pkg) | 129 s | **73 s** | **1.78×** |
| prometheus/model/labels (~4k LOC, 1 pkg) | 139 s | **90 s** | **1.55×** |
| prometheus tsdb-4 (~24k LOC, 4 pkgs) | 951 s¹ | 855 s | 1.11× |

¹ gremlins's `unleash` accepts only one target argument, so its tsdb-4 row sums 4 per-subpackage invocations; gomutants's row is a single multi-package run.

**Warm-cache rerun (full out-of-the-box workload, cache on)** — the inner edit/test loop where gomutants short-circuits unchanged mutants via the content-addressed cache. gremlins has no equivalent.

| Target | Cold OOB | Warm rerun | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| google/uuid | 77 s | 3.2 s | ~24× |
| spf13/cobra | 410 s | **2.7 s** | **~150×** |
| prometheus/model/labels | 342 s | **2.8 s** | **~120×** |
| prometheus tsdb-4 | 2768 s (~46 min) | **19 s** | **~145×** |

**Reading the numbers:**

- **Engine ordering depends on package size.** Roughly tied on uuid (~120 mutants), 1.5–1.8× faster on medium single-package targets where gomutants's pre-built test binary amortizes across many mutants, tied again on the 4-package multi-target where one-shot setup balances against gremlins's per-subpackage setup paid 4×.
- **Adaptive per-mutant timeouts win on contended runs.** Gremlins ran 26% of uuid mutants into its `--timeout-coefficient=20` ceiling under worker contention; gomutants ran 2.5%. Same pattern on tsdb-4 (196 vs 45 timeouts).

See [`docs/performance.md`](docs/performance.md) for full per-target tables, NOT_COVERED interpretation differences, Go 1.26 compatibility notes, and reproduction commands. The in-repo [`benchmarks/results.md`](benchmarks/results.md) covers `./testdata/simple/` and other in-repo targets.

## Installation

### Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/szhekpisov/gomutants@564651b902e1c9a9bf5da154126532e276e4cee5 # v0.2.3
```

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

The minimum supported version of Go for gomutants is **1.26**, both for building gomutants itself and for the project under test (gomutants shells out to `go test` in your project's toolchain). macOS and Linux on amd64/arm64 are tested in CI; Windows works wherever `go` does, though it isn't covered by automated tests.

### GitHub Action

gomutants is published as a composite action:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # required so --changed-since can reach the base ref
- uses: szhekpisov/gomutants@564651b902e1c9a9bf5da154126532e276e4cee5 # v0.2.3
  with:
    args: --changed-since origin/${{ github.base_ref }} ./...
```

Each LIVED mutant on a changed line is emitted as a `::warning file=...,line=...::` workflow command, which GitHub renders inline on the "Files changed" view. The action fails on any LIVED mutant by default (`threshold-efficacy: 100`); set `threshold-efficacy: ""` to surface annotations without failing the job.

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `args` | _required_ | Arguments forwarded to `gomutants`. The action appends `--annotations=github` automatically. |
| `version` | `latest` | gomutants version to install. With `version: latest` the action keeps a pre-installed binary on PATH; with any pinned tag/branch/SHA it always re-installs so what runs matches what was requested. |
| `threshold-efficacy` | `100` | Minimum test efficacy `%` (`KILLED/(KILLED+LIVED)`). Below threshold → exit 10. Default `100` fails the step on any LIVED mutant; set to `""` to disable. |
| `threshold-mcover` | _empty_ | Minimum mutant coverage `%` (`(KILLED+LIVED)/(KILLED+LIVED+NOT_COVERED)`). Below threshold → exit 11. Empty disables. |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Directory containing `go.mod`. |
| `cache` | `.gomutants-cache.json` | Path to the incremental-analysis cache file. Set to `off` to disable. Pair with [`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache) to persist across CI runs. |

See [`action.yml`](action.yml) for the full composite definition.

### Direct binary download

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run on the whole module.
gomutants ./...

# Run only on lines this PR changes.
gomutants --changed-since origin/main ./...

# Near drop-in for gremlins users:
gomutants unleash ./...

# Use in CI — exit code 10 if efficacy falls below the threshold:
gomutants --threshold-efficacy 80 ./...
```

## Features

- **`--changed-since <ref>`** — scope mutation testing to lines changed vs a git ref. Fast enough to gate every PR.
- **Per-test coverage routing** — each mutant runs only the tests whose coverage touches the mutated line, not the whole suite.
- **Incremental cache** — content-addressed; warm reruns skip mutants whose source bytes and tests are byte-identical to the previous run (120–150× speedup on warm reruns).
- **Resumable runs** — the cache is checkpointed mid-run, so a run killed by an OOM, a CI timeout, or a double Ctrl-C resumes from the last checkpoint instead of starting over.
- **Adaptive per-mutant timeouts** — deadlines sized from recorded per-test durations × margin, so fast tests don't wait out a multi-minute global ceiling.
- **Byte-level patching via `go test -overlay`** — generics and all Go syntax survive intact; source tree never modified.
- **16 mutators including block-level** — `BRANCH_IF`, `BRANCH_ELSE`, `BRANCH_CASE`, `EXPRESSION_REMOVE`, `STATEMENT_REMOVE` on top of 11 token-level operators.
- **OOM-safe** — each `go test` child runs in its own process group with a 2 GiB RSS cap; output capped at 1 MiB per stream.
- **Multiple report formats** — gremlins-compatible JSON (default), [Stryker `mutation-testing-elements` v2](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements) JSON, and a self-contained interactive HTML report.
- **Conservative discovery** — compile-failing mutants surface as `NOT_VIABLE` and don't inflate efficacy.
- **Inline ignore directives** — `// gomutants:disable*` comments suppress specific mutants by line, function, or regex.
- **GitHub Action** — surfaces surviving mutants as inline annotations on the PR diff.
- **Claude Code plugin** — `/gomutants:mutants` slash command runs gomutants on changed code and proposes concrete `*_test.go` cases that would kill each surviving mutant.

## Usage

```bash
gomutants [flags] <package patterns>
```

### PR-Scoped Mode

`--changed-since <ref>` scopes a run to mutants on lines added or modified since the given git ref:

```bash
# CI: gate every PR on changed lines only
gomutants --changed-since origin/main ./...

# Local: see what changed since the last commit
gomutants --changed-since HEAD~1 ./...
```

The flag runs `git diff --unified=0 <ref>` and keeps only mutants on added/modified lines. Combine with `--threshold-efficacy 100` to fail on any LIVED mutant on changed lines. A typical setup runs `--changed-since` per PR and the full tree post-merge; see [`.github/workflows/mutation.yml`](.github/workflows/mutation.yml) for an example.

### Stryker-format Reports

```bash
gomutants --stryker-output stryker-report.json ./...
```

Writes a [mutation-testing-elements v2](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements) report alongside the gremlins-format JSON. The same file feeds:

- The [`<mutation-test-report-app>`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mutation-testing-elements) web component, which renders an interactive HTML view when embedded in a page with `src="stryker-report.json"`.
- The [Stryker Dashboard](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/General/dashboard/), which hosts the report and serves a mutation-score badge:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $STRYKER_DASHBOARD_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data @stryker-report.json \
  "https://dashboard.stryker-mutator.io/api/reports/github.com/<org>/<repo>/<branch-or-sha>"
```

Once registered on `dashboard.stryker-mutator.io`, your project gets a `mutationScoreBadge` URL you can drop in this README — the same surface PIT, Stryker (JS/.NET/Scala), and Infection PHP plug into.

### HTML Reports

```bash
gomutants --html-output mutation-report.html ./...
```

Writes a single self-contained HTML file. Open it in any browser — no web server, no network access, no companion JSON file. The page bundles the [`<mutation-test-report-app>`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mutation-testing-elements) web component and the report data into one document, so it works as a CI artifact you can upload from a job and link to from a PR check.

Inside, you get a per-file efficacy sidebar and click-through annotated source: each mutated line is highlighted with the mutator name, status (KILLED / SURVIVED / NO_COVERAGE / TIMEOUT / COMPILE_ERROR), and the original-vs-replacement diff.

If you already publish to the [Stryker Dashboard](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/General/dashboard/) you don't need this flag — the dashboard renders the same report with history and a hosted badge. `--html-output` is for local viewing and CI artifacts, especially in air-gapped environments where uploading to a third-party dashboard isn't an option.

### Exit Codes & CI Integration

| Exit code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Runtime error |
| `10` | Below `--threshold-efficacy` (gremlins-compat) |
| `11` | Below `--threshold-mcover` (gremlins-compat) |

```bash
gomutants --threshold-efficacy 80 --threshold-mcover 90 ./...
```

`test_efficacy = killed / (killed + lived)` — excludes `not_viable`, `not_covered`, and `timed_out`.
`mutations_coverage = (killed + lived) / (killed + lived + not_covered)`.

### Claude Code Plugin

This repo ships a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin that exposes a `/gomutants:mutants` slash command. It runs gomutants on changed code, parses the JSON report, and proposes concrete `*_test.go` cases that would kill each surviving mutant — without editing any files. It also writes a self-contained interactive HTML report (the same one `--html-output` produces) to `/tmp/gomutants-report.html` for click-through inspection.

Install:

```text
/plugin marketplace add szhekpisov/gomutants
/plugin install gomutants@gomutants
```

Use:

```text
/gomutants:mutants                    # default: --changed-since main ./...
/gomutants:mutants ./internal/foo     # scope to a package
/gomutants:mutants --since HEAD~1     # scope by git ref
```

The plugin assumes `gomutants` is on `PATH` (`go install github.com/szhekpisov/gomutants@latest`), and falls back to `go run github.com/szhekpisov/gomutants@latest` otherwise. Plugin sources live under [`plugin/`](plugin/); the marketplace manifest is at [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json).

### Inline Ignore Directives

Annotate Go source with `// gomutants:disable*` comments to silence specific mutants. Suppressed mutants are dropped from the run entirely — they don't appear in any status bucket and don't affect `test_efficacy` or `mutations_coverage`. The aggregate count surfaces as `mutants_suppressed` in the JSON report and on the terminal summary.

Four forms:

```go
// Same line — suppress every (or one) mutator on the line of the directive.
return a + b // gomutants:disable
return a + b // gomutants:disable ARITHMETIC_BASE reason="commutative"
return a + b // gomutants:disable ARITHMETIC_BASE,INVERT_NEGATIVES

// Next line — suppress mutators on the first non-blank, non-comment line that follows.
// gomutants:disable-next-line CONDITIONALS_NEGATION reason="branch always taken in prod"
if debugMode { ... }

// Function — when placed as the doc-comment of a func, suppresses every mutant in the body.
// gomutants:disable-func reason="generated code"
func gen() { ... }

// Regexp — anywhere in the file; suppresses mutants on lines whose source text matches.
// gomutants:disable-regexp ^\s*log\. reason="logging is not behaviour"
```

<details>
<summary>Grammar and edge cases</summary>

```text
DIRECTIVE  = "// gomutants:" KIND [ WS PATTERN ] [ WS MUTATORS ] [ WS "reason=" QUOTED ]
KIND       = "disable" | "disable-next-line" | "disable-func" | "disable-regexp"
PATTERN    = present only for "disable-regexp"; first whitespace-delimited token after the kind, RE2 syntax
MUTATORS   = ( MUTATOR ("," MUTATOR)* ) | "*"   // upper-case mutator type names; "*" = all
QUOTED     = any Go-quoted string ("...", `...`, or 'c') with standard escape handling
```

- Omitting `MUTATORS` (or supplying `*`) suppresses every mutator at the directive's target.
- `reason="..."` is optional; recommended for self-documentation. Reasons surface to stderr under `--verbose`.
- Unknown mutator name → warning to stderr, that name is dropped, the rest of the directive still applies. If *every* named mutator is unknown, the directive is dropped entirely with a summary warning — a typo like `TYPP_O` must not silently disable every mutator on the line. Forward-compatible across mutator renames (rename one mutator at a time; stale names are individually skipped).
- `disable-func` placed on a non-function comment → warning, directive ignored.
- `disable-regexp` with an invalid pattern → warning, directive ignored.
- `disable-next-line` on the last line of a file (or with only blanks/comments after it) → warning, directive ignored.
- Patterns with whitespace are not supported in v1; use `\s` instead.
- Multiple `// gomutants:` directives on a single physical line are not supported (Go treats them as one comment). Combine with a comma list (`disable A,B`) or `*` instead.

</details>

### Configuration File

`.gomutants.yml` in the project root:

```yaml
workers: 10
test-cpu: 0             # 0 = let go test use GOMAXPROCS
timeout-coefficient: 10
adaptive-timeout: true  # per-test adaptive sizing; set false for single global timeout
timeout-margin: 3.0     # multiplier on per-test sums (only when adaptive)
timeout-min: 2s         # floor on per-mutant adaptive timeout
coverpkg: "./pkg/mypackage/..."
output: mutation-report.json
changed-since: ""       # set to e.g. "main" to scope runs by default
cache: ""               # path to incremental-analysis cache; "" = .gomutants-cache.json, "off" = disabled
checkpoint-interval: 10s # how often to flush the cache mid-run; 0s disables (final flush still runs)
disable: []
only: []
```

Priority: built-in defaults < config file < CLI flags. See [`.gomutants.yml.example`](.gomutants.yml.example) for a complete reference.

| LIVED | Tests passed — **test gap** |
| NOT COVERED | No test covers the mutated line |
| NOT VIABLE | Mutation causes a compile error (filtered, not counted as a kill) |
| TIMED OUT | Test execution exceeded the per-mutant timeout |

### All Flags

<details>
<summary>Complete flag reference</summary>

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--workers` | `-w` | NumCPU | Parallel workers |
| `--test-cpu` | | 0 (omit) | Value passed to inner `go test -cpu` per mutant; 0 lets go test use `GOMAXPROCS` |
| `--timeout-coefficient` | | 10 | Multiplier applied to baseline test time for the **global timeout ceiling** (also the per-mutant timeout when `--adaptive-timeout=false`) |
| `--adaptive-timeout` | | true | Use the per-test durations recorded during the coverage build to size each mutant's timeout. Pass `=false` to fall back to the single global ceiling. |
| `--timeout-margin` | | 3.0 | When adaptive: `per-mutant timeout = sum(selected test durations) × this`, clamped to `[--timeout-min, --timeout-coefficient × baseline]` |
| `--timeout-min` | | 2s | Floor for the per-mutant adaptive timeout. Absorbs cold-start, child fork, and GC pause overhead that doesn't scale with the underlying test work. |
| `--coverpkg` | | | Coverage package pattern (forwarded to `go test -coverpkg`) |
| `--output` | `-o` | `mutation-report.json` | JSON report path |
| `--config` | | `.gomutants.yml` | Config file path |
| `--disable` | | | Comma-separated mutator types to disable |
| `--only` | | | Comma-separated mutator types to run (disables all others) |
| `--changed-since` | | | Only test mutants on lines changed vs git ref (e.g. `main`, `HEAD~1`); requires a git repo |
| `--cache` | | `.gomutants-cache.json` | Path to incremental-analysis cache file. Skips mutants whose source and tests are byte-identical to the cached run. Pass `--cache=off` to disable. |
| `--checkpoint-interval` | | 10s | How often to flush completed mutant outcomes to the cache mid-run, so a hard kill (OOM, CI timeout, SIGKILL) loses at most this much progress and the next run resumes from the last checkpoint. `0` disables periodic checkpointing (the cache is then written only once, at the end). Ignored when `--cache=off`. |
| `--annotations` | | | Emit annotations for LIVED mutants. Supported: `github` (workflow-command warnings on stdout). |
| `--stryker-output` | | | Also write a [Stryker mutation-testing-elements](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements) report at this path (for the HTML viewer and Stryker Dashboard). |
| `--html-output` | | | Also write a self-contained interactive HTML mutation report at this path (Stryker mutation-testing-elements viewer bundled inline; no network access required to open). |
| `--threshold-efficacy` | | 0 | Minimum test efficacy (KILLED/(KILLED+LIVED)). Below threshold → exit 10 (gremlins-compat). 0 disables. |
| `--threshold-mcover` | | 0 | Minimum mutant coverage ((KILLED+LIVED)/(KILLED+LIVED+NOT_COVERED)). Below threshold → exit 11 (gremlins-compat). 0 disables. |
| `--dry-run` | | false | List mutants without testing |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | false | Stream each mutant as tested |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | false | Suppress header, phase lines, and per-mutant progress; only the final summary lands on stdout (warnings still go to stderr). Mutually exclusive with `--verbose`. |
| `--version` | | | Print version and exit |

Common invocations:

```bash
# Default: run on all packages with NumCPU workers.
gomutants ./...

# Faster CI: only mutants on lines this PR changes.
gomutants --changed-since origin/main ./...

# Local exploration: see what would be tested without running.
gomutants --dry-run ./...

# Verbose stream of every mutant as it completes.
gomutants -v ./...

# Quiet for CI: only the final summary on stdout (exit code still gates).
gomutants -q --threshold-efficacy 80 ./...

# Limit to specific mutators (or exclude some).
gomutants --only ARITHMETIC_BASE,CONDITIONALS_NEGATION ./...
gomutants --disable BRANCH_IF,BRANCH_ELSE ./...

# Tune for memory-tight runners.
gomutants --workers=2 ./...

# Give each go test more CPU lanes (paired with low --workers).
gomutants --workers=1 --test-cpu=8 ./...
```

`gomutants unleash ./...` is accepted unchanged for gremlins-compat scripts.

## How It Works

1. **Resolve packages** via `go list -json`.
2. **Collect coverage** with `go test -coverprofile`. Mutants on uncovered lines are filtered upfront as `NOT_COVERED`.
3. **Measure baseline test time** to set the global timeout ceiling (`baseline × --timeout-coefficient`). With `--adaptive-timeout=false` this also becomes every mutant's deadline.
4. **Discover mutants** by walking the AST and emitting byte-level patches. Address-of `&` is recognised and skipped; unary `-` is emitted by exactly one mutator.
5. **Build per-test coverage map.** Test binaries are compiled once; each test runs in isolation with `-test.run=<one>` to record the lines it covers — and its wall-time, used for adaptive per-mutant timeouts.
6. **Test mutants** in parallel:
   - Each worker owns a stable temp source file + overlay JSON.
   - Mutations are applied as byte-level patches; the original tree is never written to.
   - The mutant's covered tests are looked up; only those run via `go test -overlay -run=<regex>`.
   - Each `go test` child runs in its own process group with a 2 GiB RSS cap; output is capped at 1 MiB per stream.

Performance optimizations layered on top:

- **Per-mutant adaptive timeout.** Each mutant's deadline is `clamp(sum(selected test durations) × --timeout-margin, --timeout-min, global ceiling)`. A 50ms unit test gets a 2s floor instead of waiting out a multi-minute whole-suite ceiling, so infinite-loop mutants on fast packages trip in seconds rather than minutes. Falls back to the per-package sum when no per-test set is known, then to the global ceiling. Disable with `--adaptive-timeout=false`.
- **`GOMAXPROCS=NumCPU/workers` per child.** Without this, `--workers=10` on a 10-core box would have each child also assume 10 cores, oversubscribing 100×. With it, each child compiles + tests within its share.
- **Sort pending mutants by `(Pkg, File, Offset)` before dispatch.** The first mutant in a package pays the cold compile; subsequent ones reuse the build cache for deps and stdlib. This sort alone was a 17% wall-clock reduction.
- **`-vet=off` on the inner `go test`.** Vet runs in the user's CI on clean source; re-running it for every mutant is wasted work. Measured 17–39% per-mutant wall-clock reduction on representative packages.
- **Incremental cache.** Mutants whose source byte range and the surrounding tests are byte-identical to a prior run are skipped and their previous classifications reused. CI runs that touch one file pay for that file only.

### JSON report

Compatible with the gremlins JSON format:

```json
{
  "go_module": "github.com/example/project",
  "test_efficacy": 100,
  "mutations_coverage": 97.16,
  "mutants_total": 792,
  "mutants_killed": 772,
  "mutants_lived": 0,
  "mutants_not_viable": 0,
  "mutants_not_covered": 20,
  "mutants_suppressed": 5,
  "elapsed_time": 159.84,
  "files": [...]
}
```

`mutants_suppressed` is omitted when zero; it counts mutants dropped by `// gomutants:disable*` directives and is excluded from every other count.

## Self-efficacy (gomutants on itself)

gomutants kills **100%** of mutants in its `./internal/...` library code (every package at 100% efficacy). Statement coverage is also 100%. The CI gate fails on any surviving mutant on changed lines per PR, and on the full `./internal/...` tree post-merge — drift surfaces on the merge that introduces it.

The `main` package is excluded from mutation testing. Its mutants exercise the integration test suite (which forks gomutants subprocesses to test mutated overlays), each taking minutes; running them in CI under the same gate isn't tractable, and most surviving mutants are output-formatting drift the integration tests intentionally don't pin.

## Security & Code Quality

**Supply chain.** Releases are signed with [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/) (keyless Sigstore), ship [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) SBOMs for every artifact, and carry [SLSA Level 3](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3) build provenance. Published tags are immutable. See [Verifying Releases](#verifying-releases) for verification commands. The repo is tracked by [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/szhekpisov/gomutants) (badge above).

**Continuous checks.** Every push and PR is scanned by:

- [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) — known vulnerability detection
- [zizmor](https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor) — GitHub Actions workflow security scanning
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) — multi-linter static analysis

**Test quality.** Unit + integration test suite (the integration suite forks gomutants subprocesses to test mutated overlays end-to-end). Mutation testing gated per-PR (no LIVED mutant on changed lines) with 100% post-merge efficacy on `./internal/...` library code — the tool is dogfooded on itself, gated by its own CI gate.
