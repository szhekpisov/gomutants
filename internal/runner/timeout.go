// TimeoutPolicy decides the per-mutant `go test` deadline. Without
// adaptive sizing every mutant inherits the same baseline×coefficient
// timeout, which on multi-package projects pins workers on infinite-loop
// mutants for whole-suite-sized intervals.
//
//   - Adaptive=false → every mutant gets Global. Behavior matches pre-
//     adaptive gomutants exactly; used as the kill switch.
//   - Adaptive=true  → per-mutant timeout = clamp(baseSum*Margin, Min, Global)
//     where baseSum is the sum of selected per-test durations from the
//     coverage map (preferred), or the per-package total (fallback when
//     no per-test set is known), or 0 (degrade to Global).
//
// All clamps point in the safe direction: a missing measurement falls
// back to a longer timeout, never a shorter one. Worst-case the user
// sees pre-adaptive wait times; they never see false TIMED_OUT inflation.

	// Margin scales the observed per-test/per-package sum. 1.0 means
	// "trust the measurement exactly"; values >1 add headroom for GC,
	// scheduler jitter, mutated-code slowdowns, and contention under
	// the parallel mutation phase (which runs at higher concurrency
	// than the coverage build that produced the measurements).
	Margin float64

	// Min is the floor — the smallest value For() will return when
	// adaptive computation produces something tiny. Absorbs cold-start,
	// child fork, and GC-pause overhead that doesn't scale with the
	// underlying test work. Without it a 5ms test gets a 15ms deadline
	// (with Margin=3) and flakes on a busy machine.
	Min time.Duration

	// Adaptive is the master switch. When false, For() always returns
	// Global; the per-mutant tm/m arguments are ignored.

// Selection order (when adaptive):
//  1. Sum of selected per-test durations (the actual tests this mutant
//     will run via -run=^(TestA|TestB)$). Tightest, most accurate.
//  2. Per-package total (sum of all timed tests in the mutant's package).
//     Used when no per-test set is known — typically when the mutated
//     line isn't in any covered block, so the runner falls back to
//     running the whole package.
//  3. Global. Last resort: no measurements available at all.
//
// The output is clamped: max(scaled, Min), then min(that, Global).
// Both clamps fail safe — too-tight measurements widen to Min, and a
// pathological multiplication can never escape Global.
