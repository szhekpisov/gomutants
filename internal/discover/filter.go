// FilterByCoverage marks mutants whose positions are not covered as StatusNotCovered.
// It builds a mapping from coverage-profile paths (module-relative) to absolute paths
// to bridge the two path formats.
//
// A position is considered covered if (a) it sits inside a block with
// Count > 0, or (b) the file has at least one Count > 0 block AND the
// position sits outside every block in the profile. Case (b) lets us
// test mutants on positions Go's coverage tool doesn't instrument
// (package-level const/var initializers, select-case receive
// expressions, gaps between adjacent blocks on the same line) as long
// as the file is otherwise tested. Positions inside a Count == 0 block
// remain uncovered — the coverage tool saw them and they did not run.
